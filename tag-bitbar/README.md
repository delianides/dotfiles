Bitbar
======

Terminal based notification system. https://github.com/matryer/bitbar

## Environment

Bitbar doesn't have access to `PATH` so you have to load ENV vars [differently](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25385934/setting-environment-variables-via-launchd-conf-no-longer-works-in-os-x-yosemite)

There is an [issue](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar/issues/88) open for this in the Bitbar repo.
